    <h2>How to Make a Cupcake and Frosting</h2>
    <p>A friend of mine suggested that I try Guinness cupcakes as my next baking adventure, and they came out amazing</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cupcakes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Whisk stout beer, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Gradually mix the flour mixture ingredients into the beer mixture</li>
        <li>Spoon cupcake batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are risen and set in the middle but still soft and tender, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Whisk cocoa powder and stout beer together in a bowl. Beat in butter and cream cheese using an electric mixer until well combined. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting has desired sweetness. Spread or pipe frosting onto cooked cupcakes</li>
    </ol>
